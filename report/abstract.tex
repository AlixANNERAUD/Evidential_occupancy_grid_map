\chapter{Abstract}

In this project, we implement an evidential mapping approach using the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, a mathematical framework that allows for reasoning under uncertainty and combining evidence from multiple sources. Central to our implementation is the concept of the belief mass function, which serves as a mathematical representation of uncertainty within a given frame of discernment. This framework is particularly promising for multi-agent systems, where the integration and analysis of disparate evidence from various agents can enhance decision-making processes. Our approach applies these theories to optimize the performance of mobile robots in dynamic environments, employing advanced computational techniques such as parallelization and vectorization to improve efficiency. The potential for scaling this model to multi-agent scenarios offers significant opportunities for advancements in distributed robotic systems.
