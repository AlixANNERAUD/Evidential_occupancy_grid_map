\section{Introduction}

Our project is primarily based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence
(see articles \cite{2.5D_Evidential_Grids_for_Dynamic_Object_Detection} and \cite{Cloud_Update_of_Tiled_Evidential_Occupancy_Grid_Maps_for_the_Multi_Vehicle_Mapping})
, which is a mathematical framework for reasoning under uncertainty and combining evidence from multiple sources.
